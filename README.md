# Features


1.Create a New Account Users can easily create a new crypto account in just a few steps. This account serves as their digital wallet to store and manage cryptocurrencies securely.

2.Delete Account Users have the option to delete their crypto account. Make sure to inform users about the implications of this action, as it permanently erases their account and its associated funds.

3.Recover Account In case a user accidentally deletes their account, our wallet provides a recovery mechanism to help them regain access to their funds. Ensure you detail the recovery process, such as using a recovery phrase or other security measures.

4.Lock and Unlock Account Users can lock and unlock their accounts as needed. Locking an account adds an extra layer of security to protect their assets.

5.Transaction History Our wallet keeps a detailed history of all previous transactions. Users can easily view their transaction history, including date, time, transaction type (send or receive), and amount.

6.Transfer and Receive Cryptocurrency Users can transfer cryptocurrency to other users by providing the recipient's wallet address. They can also receive cryptocurrency from others using their wallet address.
